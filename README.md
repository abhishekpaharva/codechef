# codechef

This repository contains solutions to the [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/) implemented in C++. Some of the solutions here are partially accepted or incorrect.

# How This Respositoy is Organized

In this repository, each of the files labeled Problem_Code.cpp contain the corresponding codechef problem's solution.For example, the code for ADAKNG is located in [ADAKNG.cpp](/ADAKNG.cpp), and the file contains solution for problem.
Each of the solutions are independent of one another, don't depend on other files, and have their own main function which solves the problem and prints out the solution to the console. Using this code is as easy as downloading and running the file.

# Requriements

> Most of the problem are solved in c++14.

> Use [GNU g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for compiling cpp files.
